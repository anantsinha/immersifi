Tall and broad-shouldered, his presence exudes an unsettling charm—dark hair tousled and falling just beside piercing, ice-blue eyes that seem to hold galaxies of secrets. His jaw is clenched with quiet confidence, a thin scar slicing through his left brow hinting at stories better left untold. Dressed in a tailored black coat that drapes over broad arms, he exudes a predatory grace, every movement calculated and deliberate. As he shifts his gaze toward the woman, a slow, chiselled smirk plays at his lips, as if he senses the electricity coursing between them, a dark promise lingering just beneath the surface of his calm veneer. His voice, when he finally speaks, is low, smooth, and layered with an edge of danger, \"I’ve been waiting for you.\"'}"
